Hey!
I work on computational methods for design, especially focussing on aircraft design.

I work on the full shape optimization stack:

1. **Shape Representation:**
Developed the first non-self-intersecting geometry representation scheme: Neural Injective Geometry.
2. **Shape Evaluation:**
Physics based ML (Neural Operators etc.) for flow evaluation.
3. **Shape Optimization:**
Adjoint-based optimization, DeepRL optimization.
